# Objectives:
# 1. Set the resolution of the picture to QHD (2560x14400)
# 2. Give the sensor time to focus and adjust before taking a picture
# 3. Save the image with the date and time as the filename
# 4. Save the files within an "images" directory (assume the directory exists on the same level as the python script)
# Bonus: Modify the program to take in user input for the resolution (Adjust the capture function parameters as needed)
